# KnotebookLM RAG Service

Knotebook LM is a system which helps in summarizing information throught a RAG(Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) service. This allows more relevant information generation, and accurate outputs. You are able to create new notebooks, add sources to the notebook, and explore new ideas!

This involves the use of a Google Embeddings and a Flask API as well as LangChain's database to split, embed, and store a set of text, offering a summary of information through all of these working together with each other. Keep in mind that this is in openeing stages, and I am also having this be a school project for coding class.

This is inspired by Google's NotebookLM.
